# Pig Game üê∑üéÆüéÆ
Description: In this pig game, there are two players and the player who first reaches a score of 100 wins! Keep rolling the dice and press the hold button when you want to save it to your current score. Beware, try not to roll a 1 because it won't add up to your current score!
